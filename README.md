# Computer Engineering Student

## About

Computer Engineering student transitioning from academic learning to practical firmware development. Focused on building robust, real-time systems with emphasis on hardware-software integration. Primary interests include RTOS-based applications, bare-metal firmware development, and low-level driver implementation for resource-constrained microcontrollers.

Currently seeking opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge in production environments and contribute to projects involving real-time embedded systems, firmware optimization, and hardware abstraction layer design.
